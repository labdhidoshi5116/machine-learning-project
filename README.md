**HeartSense** is an interactive clinical decision-support web application and machine learning platform designed to predict and stratify cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using patient hemodynamic profiles, biological metrics, and lifestyle parameters. Trained on a cohort of **70,000 anonymized patient records**, the platform features a calibrated Scikit-Learn machine learning pipeline integrated into a custom Streamlit UI styled with modern clinical glassmorphism aesthetics.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **🏠 Overview Dashboard:** High-level executive statistics, cohort demographics, disease prevalence metrics, and summary cards.
* **🔬 Patient Risk Assessment:**
  * Interactive input of patient vitals (Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Systolic/Diastolic BP, Cholesterol, Glucose, Lifestyle habits).
  * Real-time disease probability estimation powered by the trained ML pipeline (`cardiovascular_logistic_regression_pipeline.pkl`).
  * Dynamic SVG radial risk gauge indicator (Low, Moderate, High Risk).
  * Clinical blood pressure staging following **JNC-7 / ACC/AHA guidelines** (Normal, Elevated, Stage 1, Stage 2, Hypertensive Crisis).
  * Body Mass Index (BMI) auto-calculation & risk classification.
  * Individualized risk factor attribution breakdown.
* **📊 Model Analytics:** Detailed transparency into the machine learning pipeline architecture, feature scaling, model coefficients, cross-validation metrics (~71.39% accuracy), confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve visualizations.
* **📁 Dataset Explorer:** Searchable, filterable view of the 70,000 patient records with configurable feature range sliders and exploratory histograms.
* **🎨 Modern Clinical UI:** Styled with a custom Emerald Cyber-Luxe dark-mode CSS design system (`style.css`), featuring custom glassmorphic cards, glowing neon status pills, responsive layout grids, and high-tech typography (Outfit, Plus Jakarta Sans, and Space Mono).

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Pipeline Architecture

1. **Preprocessing:** Standard scaling (`StandardScaler`) applied to numerical features (`age`, `height`, `weight`, `ap_hi`, `ap_lo`) to normalize feature distributions.
2. **Classifier:** Logistic Regression pipeline optimized with L2 regularization.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, achieving an accuracy of **71.39%** on test cohorts.
4. **Artifact:** Serialized pipeline object stored in `cardiovascular_logistic_regression_pipeline.pkl` for fast inference in production.
